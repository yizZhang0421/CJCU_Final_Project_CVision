google sign in just request for KEY

any platform, language...etc, just need pass the KEY, you can access your files and your functions.

so any developer just need design a file to input KEY of your users.

if you add a google sign in api mechanism, it just to convinence for user, cause you can use sign to get KEY response

that user don't need type their KEY manully.


so...First thing I need research is "how to valify sign in from"
[I SOLVE IT!! just send idtoken and your sign in client id to my server to exchange you key!!]

NEXT: test how to use google sign in from java or python
[SOLVE IT!! there is official documents below, and ypu can check a simple python example at CVision website.]

===sign in registe tutorial(optional, you can just use your KEY to access service, GSI is for convience switch user or something)===
